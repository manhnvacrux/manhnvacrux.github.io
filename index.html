                        <p>BetterPlayer has Playlist importing, its available in the Playlist page at the bottom, click
                            on 'Import'.<br><br>
                            Currently only .m3u and .m3u8 is supported. The import/export feature comes without any
                            warranties.<br><br>
                            Playlists can also be exported to the .m3u format. The absolute paths are currently used in
                            the resulting playlist
                            and may not work on other devices than your phone and using BetterPlayer.<br><br>
                            If you don't like BetterPlayer's importing/exporting there are 3rd party app in the Store
                            that can do it also, try
                            use them.<br><br>
                            More technical info on M3U: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U</a>
                            <br><br>
                            If you have problems with importing, try using different file managers, you should also try
                            using the build-in File
                            selector, long press on the 'Import' button.<br><br>

                            To Export a Playlist, long press on the Playlist you want to Export and select 'Export' from
                            the list. The playlist
                            will be exported in .m3u file to the root of the Internal storage.<br><br>
                            You can also try switching to the New custom Audio library, this is done in Advanced
                            settings.<br><br>
                            If you are getting an 'Error cannot read file' you can try using the build-in BetterPlayer
                            importer. This is found my
                            long-pressing on the 'Import' button at the bottom of the 'PLAYLISTS' page.<br></p>

                        <p>The Playlists comes without any guarantees, you should keep your important Playlists
                            backed-up using BetterPlayer or
                            3rd party app.<br><br>
                            If you lost all of your Playlists you can try restore from backup, by tapping on the top
                            'PLAYLISTS' title and then
                            hit the 'Restore from Backup' button.<br><br>
                            The Playlists may be cleared/deleted automatically by the Android system when you unmount
                            the SD-card, restart your
                            device or add new music. <br><br>
                            This is not a bug of BetterPlayer, instead its your device that does this, you can report
                            this bug to your device
                            manufacturer.<br><br>
                            If you are going to unmount the SD-card and want the Playlists safe you can Export all
                            Playlists by tapping on the
                            'PLAYLISTS' title
                            at the top and selecting 'Export all Playlists'.<br><br>
                            The Playlists are then stored in the Playlist folder in BetterPlayer folder on the External
                            storage.<br><br>
                            For a quick solution to this problem, switch to the new Custom Audio library in Advanced
                            Settings. This does not
                            have this problem. BetterPlayer will switch to this soon.<br></p>
